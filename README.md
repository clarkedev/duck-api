A simple API that gives the user a randomised duck image upon each request. 

This is an old project that I plan to revist and refresh, I now know more about APIs and would love to bring this up to date by adding the following features: 

- Duck images web scraped and stored remotely
- A nicer way to display data to users
- A dashboard to manage API settings
- A database to store:
  - Duck images
  - API keys
  - History of duck images based on API key
 

These features are only ideas and I may choose to not implement some when this is revisted.
